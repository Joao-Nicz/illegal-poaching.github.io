					<p>Black rhinos are native to Africa and are the smaller and less numerous cousins of the white rhinos. According to these black rhino poaching statistics, their numbers dwindled to 2,500 in 1995. However, that number increased substantially in the next 20 years or so and now stands at around 5,500. Despite that, the black rhino species is still classified as critically endangered, while poaching remains a massive obstacle to their continued recovery.</p>

					<p>Even though the rates have decreased in the last few years, the estimates for the future are still bleak, according to some experts. Not all agree with these statistics on poaching, but most believe that the rates are unlikely to keep falling and that they will, instead, start rising soon. We can only hope that they are wrong! By the way, one of the reasons why rhino horns are in high demand is due to the belief that they cure diseases. However, science has proven that consuming rhino horn is as beneficial as chewing on your fingernails!</p>

					<h3 class="feature-title">Poaching threatens to destroy the most iconic animals in the world, like the black rhino, the African elephant, the mountain gorilla, the lion, and the imperial zebra.</h3>

					<p>Do you know what connects all of these animals? All of them call Africa their home, and all are either endangered or very close to extinction. According to the latest facts about poaching in Africa, there are only 1,000 mountain gorillas, and 2,000 zebras left. What’s more, 43% of the lion population has disappeared in the last 21 years, while a staggering 97.6% of the black rhino population has vanished since 1960. And the elephants might have it the worst, as around 35,000 of them are killed annually. It’s highly likely that most of these species will go extinct within most of our lifetimes.</p>

					<p>Poaching in Africa statistics reveal that many countries have increased their efforts to stop it. However, the poachers are still at large. Poaching is such a massive business that some of these criminals even go as far as to assassinate people to cover their tracks.</p>

					<p>Despite such low numbers, most tiger poaching facts state that as many as 45% of tiger deaths are due to unnatural causes, and out of that, 37% are the result of poaching. Thankfully, recent reports state that India has improved the security of its tiger population, and their numbers have consequently seen a slight increase. There’s still hope for the world’s biggest cats!</p>

					<h3 class="feature-title">On average, 2 rangers are killed worldwide every week.</h3>

						<img src="images/ranger1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" title="National Geographic">
					</a>
					<p>It’s impossible to give the exact numbers as the data is not collected nor kept in all countries worldwide, but we do have estimates. According to Sean Willmore, the president of the International Ranger Federation, around two rangers are killed every week. About half of them are murdered by poachers, while the other half dies in workplace accidents. Bear in mind that the facts about poaching casualties are just estimates, and Sean, like many others, believes the number is most likely much higher. </p>
